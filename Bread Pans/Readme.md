## Bill of Materials


Servo Linkage - 1 per Front Bread Pan.  I do not have servos in the rear bread pans.

3mm rod for arm pivot.  Cut 2 pieces to 45mm long for each bread pan.

Magnets are 15x6x2mm Neodynium rectangular magnets.  You need 8 per bread pan.  The link below comes with 30, so should be enough for all 4 bread pans.

## Installation
Place bread pan in postioin, install the skins to line up where you want them to sit, then scratch the opening on the frame of the holes.  Drill and tap the two holes.  You can see that my holes weren't perfect since one of them didn't quite fall within my scratched marks.
